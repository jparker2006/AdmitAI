When the pandemic hit, their corner market faced unprecedented challenges. Revenue dropped by 60%, and they were considering closing permanently. I felt helpless watching their 20-year dream crumble, but this crisis sparked an idea that would transform my understanding of business purpose.

I launched a tutoring service, connecting high-achieving students with peers who needed academic support. What started as a way to help my family financially evolved into something much larger. Within six months, we had generated $15,000 in revenue and employed eight tutors, helping over 40 students improve their grades by an average of 1.2 GPA points."""
