# TASK-003: Agent Memory Enhancement

## Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

## Objective
Enhance the AgentMemory system to support ReAct pattern operations with efficient context management, conversation tracking, and intelligent memory retrieval.

## Background
Current foundation has basic memory structure. Need to add ReAct-specific memory capabilities including reasoning history, tool usage patterns, and contextual retrieval.

## Files to Enhance
- `essay_agent/agent/memory/agent_memory.py`
- `essay_agent/agent/memory/context_retrieval.py` (new)
- `essay_agent/agent/memory/memory_indexer.py` (new)

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. ReAct Memory Extensions
- Reasoning chain storage
- Tool execution history
- Decision context tracking
- Error pattern recognition

### 2. Context Retrieval Engine
- Semantic search capabilities
- Relevance scoring
- Memory summarization
- Context window optimization

### 3. Memory Indexing System
- Efficient storage and retrieval
- Cross-reference capabilities
- Pattern detection
- Performance optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Memory supports ReAct reasoning patterns
- [ ] Context retrieval is efficient and relevant
- [ ] Memory indexing enables fast lookups
- [ ] Integration with existing memory system
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage

## Time Estimate: 45 minutes
