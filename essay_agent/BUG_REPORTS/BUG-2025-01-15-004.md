## BUG-2025-01-15-004

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Reporter**: Comprehensive Test Suite  
**Severity**: **High**  
**Status**: New

## Summary
Conversation state management fails to properly save and retrieve draft content between tools, causing cascading failures in revise/polish workflow

## Test Scenario
**Affected Scenarios**: HP-005 (service_leader profile)  
**Specific Pattern**: Draft tool succeeds but revise tool receives empty draft  
**Test Command**: `python tests/run_conversation_tests.py --all`

## Expected Behavior
1. Draft tool generates essay content successfully ✅
2. Draft content saved to conversation state ❌
3. Revise tool retrieves non-empty draft for revision ❌
4. Polish tool retrieves revised draft for final polishing ❌

## Actual Behavior
1. Draft tool succeeds: `Tool draft returned: {'ok': {'draft': 'The first time I stepped into the bustling environment...'}}`
2. Revise tool receives empty draft: `'draft': ''`
3. Revise tool fails: `draft must be a non-empty string`
4. Polish tool also receives empty draft and fails

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run scenario HP-005 (service_leader, yale_passion)
2. User input: "Write an essay about my homeless shelter work" 
3. Draft tool executes successfully (26.8s, generates content)
4. User input: "Make it more personal and emotional"
5. Revise tool fails with empty draft parameter

## Error Details
```
[DEBUG] Tool draft returned: {'ok': {'draft': 'The first time I stepped into the bustling environment of the homeless shelter, I was overwhelmed by a mix of emotions—compassion, urgency, and a deep-seated desire to make a difference...'}}

[DEBUG] Tool execution results: ['draft:ExecutionStatus.SUCCESS']
[08:41:00.186] Conversation state saved for user test_HP-005_1752568831

# Later when revise tool executes:
'draft': '',  // PROBLEM: Empty draft passed to revise tool
'revision_focus': 'clarity and flow'

[ERROR] Tool revise execution failed: draft must be a non-empty string
```

## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue**: Conversation state management breakdown
1. Draft tool generates content successfully 
2. Content appears in tool result: `{'ok': {'draft': '..long essay content..'}}`
3. Conversation state claims to save: `Conversation state saved for user`
4. But subsequent tools receive empty draft: `'draft': ''`

**State Management Chain Failure**:
```
Draft Tool SUCCESS → Conversation State → Revise Tool EMPTY
     ✅                      ❓                    ❌
```

## Impact Assessment  
- **User Experience**: Partial workflow failure - essays generate but can't be improved
- **Data Integrity**: Draft content generated but lost in state transitions
- **System Reliability**: Inconsistent state management across tool executions
- **Workflow Continuity**: Breaks multi-step revision workflows

## Technical Details
**Working Example (HP-005)**:
- Draft generation: 26.8s execution, 650+ word essay created
- State transition: Claims successful save but content not retrieved
- Revise/Polish: Both tools fail due to missing draft content

**Expected State Flow**:
```
ConversationState.current_draft = draft_tool_result['ok']['draft']
ReviseToolExecution.kwargs['draft'] = ConversationState.current_draft  
```

**Actual State Flow**:
```
ConversationState.current_draft = ??? (empty or not saved)
ReviseToolExecution.kwargs['draft'] = ''  // Empty string
```

## Investigation Areas
1. **State Persistence**: How is draft content saved in ConversationState?
2. **State Retrieval**: How do subsequent tools access previous tool results?
3. **Tool Result Processing**: Is draft content properly extracted from tool results?
4. **Memory Management**: Are tool results cleared between conversation turns?

## Related Issues
- **BUG-2025-01-15-003**: Primary draft tool failures mask this state management issue
- **Tool Chaining**: Similar issues may affect other tool-to-tool content passing

## Proposed Fix Areas
1. **ConversationState.save_draft()**: Ensure draft content properly persisted
2. **Tool Parameter Building**: Verify draft content retrieved from state for revise/polish
3. **State Debugging**: Add logging to trace content through state transitions
4. **Content Validation**: Verify non-empty content before tool execution
