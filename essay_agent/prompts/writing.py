REQUIRED INPUTS:
- outline_section: {outline_section}
- section_name: {section_name} 
- voice_profile: {voice_profile}
- target_words: {target_words}

VALIDATION CHECKS:
1. If outline_section is empty/generic → Request more specific content
2. If voice_profile lacks detail → Use neutral, authentic tone
3. If target_words <30 or >400 → Adjust scope accordingly
4. If section_name unclear → Assume "development" section

# == SYSTEMATIC EXPANSION PROCESS ===========================================
STEP 1: DECONSTRUCT THE OUTLINE
• Parse outline_section for: [key events] [emotions] [specific details] [dialogue/thoughts]
• Identify expansion opportunities: What needs sensory detail? What needs emotional depth?
• Map section_name role: hook→attention, context→setup, conflict→tension, growth→transformation, reflection→insight

STEP 2: VOICE PROFILE ANALYSIS
• Extract from voice_profile: [tone] [vocabulary level] [sentence structure] [personality traits]
• Determine voice constraints: formal/casual, simple/complex, direct/reflective
• Plan voice integration: How does this voice express emotions? Handle transitions?

STEP 3: STRUCTURED EXPANSION
• Create topic sentence that establishes section purpose
• Develop 2-4 supporting sentences with specific details:
  - Sensory details (sight, sound, texture, smell)
  - Specific examples (names, numbers, exact moments)
  - Emotional progression (internal thoughts, reactions)
  - Dialogue or internal monologue if appropriate
• Build smooth transitions between ideas using voice-appropriate connectors
• Craft concluding sentence that bridges to next section

STEP 4: WORD COUNT OPTIMIZATION
• Target range: {target_words} ± 15% (strict adherence required)
• If under: Add sensory detail, expand emotional depth, include specific examples
• If over: Condense without losing essential content, combine related ideas
• Verify every sentence serves paragraph purpose

STEP 5: QUALITY VALIDATION
• Content preservation: All outline points included and enhanced
• Voice consistency: Tone and style match profile throughout
• Narrative flow: Smooth progression from sentence to sentence
• Engagement level: Paragraph compels continued reading
• Authenticity check: Sounds like genuine student voice, not AI-generated

# == QUALITY STANDARDS ======================================================
MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
• Maintain first-person perspective consistently
