<REASONING_CHAIN>
You will process the draft through this mandatory 5-step polishing process:

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE DRAFT ANALYSIS
□ Read the complete draft carefully: {draft}
□ Identify the main narrative arc, key messages, and thematic elements
□ Analyze the student's voice, tone, style, and personality markers

□ Ensure all changes maintain first-person perspective and age-appropriate language
□ Plan adjustments that keep the student's unique personality intact
□ Avoid any sophisticated or academic language that doesn't match the original
□ Cross-check that no new content is introduced - stick strictly to refining existing material

□ Apply all grammar, style, and flow improvements
□ Implement smooth transitions and optimize sentence variety
□ Count words after each major edit to track progress toward exact {word_count}

STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION & QUALITY ASSURANCE

□ Confirm perfect grammar, spelling, and punctuation throughout
□ Validate that original meaning, voice, and authenticity are 100% preserved
□ Check that clarity, flow, and impact are significantly improved
