"""essay_agent.prompts.draft

High-stakes production prompt for expanding an outline into a full first-person draft.
The prompt is built with the shared ``make_prompt`` helper so it can be rendered to a
string via ``render_template``.  Downstream code must pass the following variables:

* ``outline`` – JSON or rich-text outline structure to expand.
* ``voice_profile`` – Short description of the writer's authentic voice.
* ``word_count`` – Target word count for the final draft.

The prompt enforces:
1. Preservation of the user's voice.
2. Vivid detail and smooth transitions.
3. Strict JSON-only output: ``{"draft": "..."}``.
