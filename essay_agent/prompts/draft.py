"""essay_agent.prompts.draft

High-stakes production prompt for expanding an outline into a full first-person draft.
The prompt is built with the shared ``make_prompt`` helper so it can be rendered to a
string via ``render_template``.  Downstream code must pass the following variables:

* ``outline`` – JSON or rich-text outline structure to expand.
* ``voice_profile`` – Short description of the writer's authentic voice.
* ``word_count`` – Target word count for the final draft.

Updated to separate content generation from word count enforcement.
Word count validation and adjustment handled by external WordCountTool.

• Identify tone, style, vocabulary level, and personality traits
• Ensure consistency with this voice throughout the draft

STEP 3: EXPAND EACH SECTION
• HOOK: Create an engaging opening that draws readers in immediately
• CONTEXT: Provide necessary background while maintaining narrative flow
