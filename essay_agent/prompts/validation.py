# === CLICHE DETECTION PROTOCOL ===

Identify these common college essay clichés:
- "Changed my life" / "Life-changing experience"

- "Follow your dreams" / "Anything is possible"
- "Learning experience" / "Valuable lesson"
- "Comfort zone" / "Step out of comfort zone"
- "Journey of discovery" / "Found my calling"

**STEP 2: SEVERITY ASSESSMENT**
Rate each cliché:
- **Critical (5)**: Extremely overused, immediately recognizable
- **High (4)**: Very common, significantly weakens essay
- **Medium (3)**: Moderately overused, should be revised
- **Low (2)**: Somewhat common but acceptable
- **Minor (1)**: Rare usage, minimal impact

**STEP 3: CONTEXT ANALYSIS**
