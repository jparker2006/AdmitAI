Create a structured outline with these 5 parts:

1. HOOK - Compelling opening that grabs attention and sets the scene
2. CONTEXT - Background information that establishes stakes and setting  
3. CONFLICT/CHALLENGE - The central problem, obstacle, or tension
4. GROWTH/ACTION - How you responded, what you learned, actions taken
5. REFLECTION - Lessons learned, future impact, deeper insights

Requirements:
- Make it specific and personal based on the student's actual background
- Include vivid details and concrete examples from their experiences
- Show genuine growth and self-reflection
- Connect clearly to the essay prompt
- Each section should be 2-3 sentences describing what to include
