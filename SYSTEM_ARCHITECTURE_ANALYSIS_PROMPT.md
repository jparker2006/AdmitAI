# Essay Agent System Architecture Analysis - 100x Comprehensive Prompt

## üéØ Mission: Create Complete System Architecture Diagram

You are tasked with conducting a **comprehensive analysis** of the essay writing agent system and creating a **detailed system architecture diagram** that shows exactly how user input flows through the entire system to generate personalized responses.

## üîç Analysis Objectives

### Primary Goal
Create a **visual system architecture diagram** (Mermaid flowchart) that clearly shows:
1. **User Input Entry Points** - Where requests come into the system
2. **Agent Planning Flow** - How the agent reasons and selects actions
3. **Context Engine Integration** - How user context is managed and injected
4. **Tool Execution Pipeline** - How tools are selected, parameterized, and executed
5. **Response Generation** - How tool results are composed into final responses
6. **Memory & Persistence** - How user data is stored and retrieved
7. **Data Flow** - Complete path from user input to final response

### Secondary Goals
- **Identify key components** and their responsibilities
- **Map data flow** between components
- **Understand integration points** where components interact
- **Document the ReAct pattern** implementation (Observe ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Respond)
- **Show context injection** at each stage

- Map how input gets passed to the core agent

### Phase 2: Agent Core Analysis  
**Question**: How does the autonomous agent work?
- Examine agent_autonomous.py in detail
- Identify the ReAct pattern implementation (_observe, _reason, _act, _respond)
- Understand how the agent decides what to do with user input
- Map the decision-making flow

### Phase 3: Context Engine Analysis
**Question**: How is user context managed?
- Examine intelligence/context_engine.py
- Understand how user profiles are loaded and injected
- See how context snapshots are created
- Map context flow through the system

### Phase 4: Tool Execution Analysis
**Question**: How are tools selected and executed?
- Examine tools/smart_orchestrator.py for tool selection logic
- Examine utils/arg_resolver.py for parameter resolution
- Understand how tools receive context and parameters
- Map the tool execution pipeline

### Phase 5: Response Generation Analysis
**Question**: How are final responses created?
- Examine _compose_response() in agent_autonomous.py
- Understand how tool results are turned into natural responses
- See how personalization is applied
- Map the response generation flow

### Phase 6: Memory System Analysis
**Question**: How is user data persisted and retrieved?
- Examine memory/simple_memory.py
- Understand user profile structure
- See how conversation history is maintained
- Map memory operations throughout the system
