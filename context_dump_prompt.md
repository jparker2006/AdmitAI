# Essay Agent Evaluation Context Dump

## What We Just Implemented
We just completed **Section 7.7 Â· Reliability Improvements** from the essay_agent TODO list, focusing on addressing evaluation failures and improving system stability.

### Key Problems We Fixed
1. **Low Keyword Similarity**: Essays weren't addressing prompt keywords effectively (0.000-0.214 vs target â‰¥0.3)
2. **Incomplete College Scoping**: College-aware story selection logic needed verification
3. **Insufficient Error Debugging**: Hard to diagnose tool failures without better logging

### Changes Made (4 Files Modified)

**essay_agent/eval/metrics.py**:
- Added `keyword_similarity_debug()` method providing detailed keyword coverage analysis
- Added `prompt_alignment_detailed()` method for granular prompt-story fit analysis  
- Both methods maintain backward compatibility with existing `score()` method

**essay_agent/prompts/draft.py**:
- Added `extracted_keywords` parameter to draft prompt template
- Integrated keyword requirements into writing instructions
- Added keyword compliance checklist to validation process
- Enhanced self-validation with mandatory keyword verification

**essay_agent/tools/brainstorm.py**:
- Added `_verify_college_id_usage()` method to verify college_id parameter usage
- Enhanced `_debug_story_selection()` with college ID verification logging
- Improved `_update_user_profile_with_stories()` with college-aware logging

**essay_agent/tools/outline.py**:
- Added `_extract_and_plan_keywords()` for extracting key terms from prompts
- Added `_plan_keyword_integration()` to distribute keywords across outline sections
- Enhanced `_run()` method to include keyword planning in outline generation

### Test Coverage
Created 42 tests across 3 test suites (100% passing):
- **test_keyword_similarity_debug.py** (18 tests)
- **test_college_id_verification.py** (9 tests)  
- **test_keyword_outline_planning.py** (15 tests)

## Expected Improvements from This Implementation

### 1. Keyword Similarity Scores
- **Before**: 0.000-0.214 (failing threshold of â‰¥0.3)
- **Expected**: Should see scores â‰¥0.3 due to:
  - Systematic keyword extraction from prompts
  - Keywords integrated into draft instructions
  - Self-validation requiring keyword coverage

### 2. College-Scoped Story Selection
- **Before**: Uncertain if college_id parameter was being used correctly
- **Expected**: Should see debug logs showing:
  - College ID verification messages
  - College-aware story selection decisions
  - Proper story tracking per college

### 3. Error Debugging & Diagnostics
- **Before**: Limited visibility into tool failures
- **Expected**: Should see detailed debugging info for:
  - Keyword coverage analysis (matched/missing keywords)
  - Prompt-story alignment scores by theme
  - Story selection reasoning with college context

### 4. Prompt-Story Alignment
- **Before**: Stories not well-matched to prompt types
- **Expected**: Should see better alignment through:
  - Theme-based prompt analysis (identity/passion/challenge/achievement/community)
  - Keyword-driven story selection
  - Enhanced story categorization

## What to Look For in Results

### Success Indicators âœ…
- **Keyword Similarity**: Scores â‰¥0.3 for all prompt types
- **College Scoping**: Debug logs showing college ID usage
- **Error Rates**: Fewer tool failures and better error diagnostics
- **Story Diversity**: Different stories for different prompt types within same college

### Failure Patterns to Watch ðŸš¨
- **Still Low Keyword Scores**: May need stronger LLM prompt compliance
- **College Scoping Issues**: Verify college_id parameter passing through tool chain
- **Draft Quality**: Keyword integration might feel forced/unnatural
- **Performance**: Added debugging shouldn't significantly slow execution

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Run the evaluation**: `python -m essay_agent.eval.run_real_eval --debug`

2. **Check keyword scores**: Look for similarity scores in results - should be â‰¥0.3

3. **Review debug logs**: Look for:
   - College ID verification messages
   - Keyword extraction and planning logs
   - Story selection reasoning

4. **Identify remaining issues**: What still needs fixing to reach 80% pass rate?

5. **Performance check**: Did changes slow down execution significantly?

## Next Steps Based on Results
- If keyword scores still low â†’ strengthen LLM prompt compliance
- If college scoping still broken â†’ verify parameter passing
- If draft quality poor â†’ refine keyword integration approach
- If performance degraded â†’ optimize debugging overhead

## Target Metrics
- **Pass Rate**: â‰¥80% (up from previous lower rate)
- **Keyword Similarity**: â‰¥0.3 for all prompts
- **Tool Failure Rate**: <10%
- **Story Diversity**: Different stories for different prompt types per college

**YOUR TASK**: Run the evaluation, analyze the results against these expectations, and tell me what still needs fixing to achieve the 80% pass rate target.
