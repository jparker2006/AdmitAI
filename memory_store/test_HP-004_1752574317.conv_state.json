I've written your essay draft (625 words):\n\nThe moment I stepped onto the stage to deliver my speech, I felt a wave of vulnerability wash over me. The auditorium was filled with the soft murmur of students settling into their seats, the faint smell of freshly polished wood mingling with the scent of anticipation. It was the annual school assembly, and I was about to share a deeply personal story about my struggles with anxiety and depression. As I looked out at the sea of faces, some familiar, others not, I realized that this was more than just a speech; it was an opportunity to connect with my peers on a level that went beyond the superficial.\n\nGrowing up, I often felt like I was living in two worlds. At home, I was immersed in my Indian heritage, celebrating Diwali with family, the air thick with the aroma of incense and the vibrant colors of saris and rangoli designs. We spoke Gujarati with my grandparents, their voices a comforting melody of tradition and love. At school, I was just another student trying to fit in, my lunchbox filled with the spicy scents of homemade curry, a stark contrast to the peanut butter sandwiches around me. This duality was both a source of pride and a challenge, as I navigated the complexities of identity and belonging.\n\nMy involvement in the Cultural Heritage Club, which I co-founded, was a way to bridge these worlds. We created a space where multicultural students could share their traditions, and the club grew from just five members to forty, hosting eight cultural celebrations. I remember the first event, a Diwali celebration, where the gym was transformed with strings of lights and the sound of Bollywood music filled the air. It was a testament to the power of acceptance and authenticity.\n\nHowever, beneath the surface, I was grappling with anxiety and depression. The pressure to excel academically, maintain my cultural identity, and fit in socially was overwhelming. It was during this time that I became an advocate for mental health awareness, speaking at assemblies to reduce stigma and encourage others to seek help. I wanted to create a space where people felt safe to express their struggles without fear of judgment.\n\nThe conflict came to a head during my junior year when I decided to share my personal mental health journey with the entire school. It was a daunting prospect, but I knew it was necessary. As I spoke about my experiences, I felt a sense of liberation. The vulnerability I displayed was met with empathy and understanding, and I realized that sharing my struggles could empower others. The response was overwhelming; the usage of the counseling center increased by 30%, and students began to approach me to share their own stories.\n\nThrough this experience, I learned the importance of authenticity and acceptance. By being true to myself and embracing all aspects of my identity, I was able to create a space where others could do the same. This journey has shaped my future goals, as I plan to major in Psychology and continue advocating for mental health awareness. I want to help others navigate their own challenges and create environments where everyone feels accepted and understood.\n\nReflecting on this journey, I am grateful for the courage it took to step onto that stage. It was a defining moment that redefined my perspective on vulnerability and connection. I now understand that sharing our stories can be a powerful tool for change, and I am committed to using my voice to make a difference in the world. As I left the stage that day, the applause still ringing in my ears, I felt a profound sense of hope and determination, knowing that this was just the beginning of my journey.\n\nWould you like me to revise any part of this draft?",
