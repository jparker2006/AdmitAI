      "agent_response": "\u270d\ufe0f **Essay Draft Completed**\n\nExcellent! I've written your essay draft (609 words):\n\nThe moment I realized the power of small actions to create profound change was when I helped a homeless individual find stable housing. It was a chilly November evening, and I was volunteering at the local homeless shelter, a place that had become a second home to me over the past three years. The crisp air bit at my cheeks as I entered the bustling shelter, the warmth inside a stark contrast to the cold outside. As the Volunteer Coordinator, I had organized countless meal services and life skills workshops, but this encounter was different.\n\nThe shelter was alive with activity, the aroma of warm soup mingling with the scent of freshly baked bread, creating a comforting atmosphere. Volunteers moved with purpose, their chatter blending with the clatter of dishes. Amidst this organized chaos, I noticed a man sitting alone in the corner, his eyes fixed on the floor. His name was Tom, and he had been a regular at the shelter for months. Despite his quiet demeanor, there was a palpable sense of despair about him that tugged at my heart.\n\nI approached Tom with a warm smile and a bowl of soup, hoping to offer more than just a meal. \"Hey Tom,\" I said gently, \"mind if I join you?\" He nodded, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips. As we talked, he shared his story\u2014a series of unfortunate events that had led him to the streets. Listening to him, I felt a deep sense of empathy, a core value that has always driven my desire to help others. It was then that I decided to do more than just listen; I wanted to help him find a way out of his situation.\n\nThe process was not easy. Navigating the housing application system was daunting, filled with bureaucratic hurdles and endless paperwork. But I was determined. I spent hours researching housing options, filling out forms, and making phone calls. Each small step felt like a monumental task, but I was fueled by the hope of making a tangible difference in Tom's life. I remember the late nights, the glow of my computer screen illuminating the room as I sifted through resources, my heart set on finding a solution.\n\nFinally, after weeks of persistence, we received the news we had been waiting for\u2014Tom had been accepted into a housing program. The transformation in him was immediate and profound. The despair that had once clouded his eyes was replaced with a glimmer of hope. \"I can't believe it,\" he said, his voice trembling with emotion. \"Thank you for not giving up on me.\" Witnessing this change was a defining moment for me, reinforcing my belief in the power of service and community.\n\nThis experience taught me that empathy and dedication can drive meaningful change, even in the face of overwhelming challenges. It solidified my commitment to a career in social work, where I can continue to serve and support those in need. As I look towards my future at institutions like Columbia and UCLA, I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills, so I can make an even greater impact.\n\nReflecting on this journey, I am reminded that every small action counts. Whether it's serving a meal or helping someone navigate the complexities of life, each act of service contributes to a larger tapestry of change. This is the path I am passionate about, and I am excited to continue walking it, one step at a time. The warmth of the shelter, the stories shared, and the lives touched have all woven into the fabric of who I am and who I aspire to be.\n\nWould you like me to revise any part of this draft?",
