  "notes": "--- OUTLINE ---\nStory: starting a tutoring business\n\n1. HOOK:\n   As I stood in front of a room full of eager students, I realized that my journey from a single tutoring session to a thriving business was more than just about academics\u2014it was about empowerment.\n\n2. CONTEXT:\n   Growing up in a community where educational resources were scarce, I was driven to bridge this gap. My experience as the Founder & President of the Student-Run Investment Club and Secretary-General of a Model UN Conference had taught me leadership, but starting a tutoring business was a new frontier.\n\n3. CONFLICT:\n   The initial challenge was daunting: how to create a sustainable business model that not only provided quality education but was also accessible to all. Financial constraints, finding qualified tutors, and gaining the trust of parents were significant hurdles.\n\n4. GROWTH:\n   I tackled these challenges by leveraging my network from the Investment Club to secure funding, and my organizational skills from Model UN to recruit and train passionate tutors. Each obstacle taught me resilience and adaptability, and I learned the importance of community engagement and feedback.\n\n5. REFLECTION:\n   This experience taught me that true leadership is about service and adaptability. It reinforced my belief in the power of education to transform lives, a lesson I carry forward as I aspire to create impactful educational policies. My journey with the tutoring business is a testament to the fact that challenges are opportunities in disguise.\n\nTarget: 650 words",
