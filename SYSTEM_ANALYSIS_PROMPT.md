# Essay Agent System Analysis Prompt

## Context
You are analyzing an essay writing agent system that helps students brainstorm and write college application essays. The system uses a ReAct pattern (Observe → Reason → Act → Respond) with contextual composition for natural responses.

## Recent Achievement ✅
**MAJOR SUCCESS: Contextual Composition System Working**
- Frontend DebugAgent now properly structures tool results 
- `_compose_response()` generates personalized, conversational responses
- Agent correctly references user profile (Alex Kim's investment club, tutoring business, Model UN)
- Memory persistence working (college: Stanford, essay prompt stored correctly)

## Current Issue 🔍
**Tool Results Not Personalized**: Brainstorm tool returns generic stories instead of user-specific ones.

### Example:
**User Profile**: Alex Kim - business activities (investment club, tutoring business, Model UN)
**Tool Output**: Generic stories (debate stage fright, science experiment, robotics conflict)
**Agent Response**: ✅ Correctly personalizes the generic results with Alex's context

## System Architecture

### Core Components:
1. **AutonomousEssayAgent** (`agent_autonomous.py`)
   - Implements ReAct pattern: `_observe()` → `_reason()` → `_act()` → `_respond()`
   - `_compose_response()`: Uses LLM to create contextual responses from tool results
   - `_build_composition_prompt()`: Builds comprehensive context for response generation

2. **Frontend DebugAgent** (`frontend/server.py`)
   - `_act_with_debug()`: Now properly returns `{"type": "tool_result", "tool_name": "...", "result": {...}}`
   - `ResponseEnhancer`: Adds empathetic tone to responses
   - Real-time debug monitoring of tool executions

3. **SmartOrchestrator** (`tools/smart_orchestrator.py`)
   - Tool selection and execution logic
   - Multi-tool workflow management

4. **Memory System**
   - User profiles: `alex_kim.json` (background, activities, interests)
   - Conversation history: `alex_kim_Stanford_current.conv.json`
   - Context persistence across sessions

5. **Tool Registry** (`tools/`)
   - `brainstorm` tool: Generates story ideas for essays
   - Parameter resolution: `ArgResolver` maps context to tool parameters

## Current Test Scenario
**User**: Alex Kim (business-focused student)
**College**: Stanford 
**Essay Prompt**: "Tell me about a time you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?"
**User Request**: "Help me brainstorm ideas for this essay"

## Tool Execution Flow
```
1. User sends brainstorm request
2. Agent reasons → selects brainstorm tool
3. SmartOrchestrator executes tool with parameters:
   - essay_prompt: "Tell me about a time you faced..."
   - profile: "New applicant; profile pending"  ⚠️ NOT PERSONALIZED
   - college: "this college"  ⚠️ GENERIC
4. Tool returns generic stories (debate, science, robotics)
5. _compose_response() personalizes the response using Alex's profile
6. Final response: Contextual, mentions investment club/tutoring/Model UN ✅
```

## What's Working ✅
1. **Frontend Integration**: DebugAgent properly structures tool results
2. **Contextual Composition**: `_compose_response()` creates natural, personalized responses
3. **Memory Persistence**: User profiles and conversation context maintained
4. **Response Quality**: Natural tone, personal greetings, relevant guidance
5. **Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks and structured error responses
6. **Debug Monitoring**: Real-time tool execution tracking

## What Needs Improvement ❌
1. **Tool Parameter Personalization**: Tools receive generic context instead of user-specific data
2. **Profile Integration**: User profile not passed to brainstorm tool effectively
3. **Story Relevance**: Generated stories don't match user's background/interests

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified:
- `essay_agent/agent_autonomous.py`: Added `_compose_response()` and `_build_composition_prompt()`
- `essay_agent/frontend/server.py`: Fixed `_act_with_debug()` to return proper action_result structure
- `essay_agent/utils/arg_resolver.py`: Added user_input parameter mapping

### Actual Alex Kim Profile (Rich Context Available):
```json
{
  "name": "Alex Kim",
  "intended_major": "Business Administration",
  "activities": [
    {
      "name": "Student-Run Investment Club",
      "role": "Founder & President", 
      "impact": "Portfolio returned 12% annually, taught 50+ students"
    },
    {
      "name": "Local Tutoring Business",
      "role": "Founder & CEO",
      "impact": "Generated $15,000 revenue, employed 8 tutors, helped 40+ students"
    },
    {
      "name": "Model United Nations",
      "role": "Secretary-General",
      "impact": "Doubled club membership, won best delegation at 5 conferences"
    }
  ],
  "defining_moments": [
    {
      "title": "Starting a Business During Family Financial Struggles",
      "themes": ["entrepreneurship", "family support", "resilience"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Learning to Balance Profit with Purpose", 
      "themes": ["business ethics", "social responsibility"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Teaching Investment Fundamentals to Skeptical Peers",
      "themes": ["financial education", "peer teaching"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**ISSUE**: Brainstorm tool completely ignores this rich, relevant context!

### Current Tool Parameters (Issue):
```json
{
  "essay_prompt": "Tell me about a time you faced...",
  "profile": "New applicant; profile pending",  // ❌ Should be Alex's full profile
  "college": "this college",                    // ❌ Should be "Stanford"
  "used_stories": [],
  "cross_college_suggestions": []
}
```

## Analysis Questions

1. **Tool Personalization**: Why isn't the brainstorm tool receiving Alex's detailed profile? Where in the parameter resolution flow does personalization fail?

2. **Context Injection**: How should we modify `ArgResolver.resolve()` or `build_params()` to pass rich user context to tools?

3. **Profile-Story Matching**: Should we add a pre-filtering step to generate stories that match the user's activities and background?

4. **Architecture Optimization**: Is the current two-step approach (generic tool → personalized response) optimal, or should tools generate personalized results directly?

5. **Scalability**: How will this approach scale when we have multiple users with different profiles and contexts?

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Natural, conversational responses (ACHIEVED)
- ❌ Personalized tool results that match user background (PENDING)
- ✅ Proper memory and context persistence (ACHIEVED)
- ✅ Error-free tool execution (ACHIEVED)

## Recommendations Needed
Please analyze this system and provide:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Why are tools getting generic instead of personalized parameters?
2. **Proposed Solutions**: How to fix tool parameter personalization?
3. **Architecture Assessment**: Is the current contextual composition approach optimal?
4. **Implementation Priority**: What should be fixed first for maximum impact?
5. **Future Improvements**: What enhancements would make the biggest difference?

The goal is a system where brainstorm tools generate stories directly relevant to Alex Kim's business background (investment challenges, tutoring setbacks, Model UN conflicts) rather than generic academic scenarios.

## Key Code Snippets for Analysis

### 1. Current Parameter Resolution (`utils/arg_resolver.py`):
```python
class ArgResolver:
    def resolve(self, tool_name: str, user_id: str = None, user_input: str = "", context: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # How are user profiles being passed to tools?
        # Is load_user_profile() being called?
        # Are profile details being extracted and formatted?
```

### 2. Brainstorm Tool Implementation (`tools/brainstorm_tools.py`):
```python
def _run(self, prompt: str, profile: str = None, college: str = None, **kwargs):
    # Current tool expects 'profile' as string
    # Should it receive structured profile data instead?
    # How should we format Alex's rich profile for the LLM?
```

### 3. Tool Execution in SmartOrchestrator:
```python
# How does the orchestrator build parameters for tools?
# Is it calling ArgResolver.resolve() correctly?
# Are user profiles being loaded and formatted properly?
```

### 4. Expected vs. Actual Tool Parameters:

**What Alex's profile SHOULD provide:**
```json
{
  "profile": "Alex Kim: Business-focused student. Founded investment club managing $10K portfolio (12% returns), started tutoring business ($15K revenue, 8 employees), MUN Secretary-General. Defining moments: starting business during family financial struggles, balancing profit with purpose in tutoring, teaching investment fundamentals to skeptical peers.",
  "college": "Stanford",
  "user_activities": ["investment club", "tutoring business", "model UN"],
  "potential_challenges": ["family financial struggles", "business ethics dilemmas", "peer skepticism about investing"]
}
```

**What tool currently receives:**
```json
{
  "profile": "New applicant; profile pending",
  "college": "this college"
}
```

## Hypothesis: Parameter Resolution Gap
The issue likely occurs in one of these areas:
1. **ArgResolver not loading user profile** from `load_user_profile(user_id)`
2. **Profile not being formatted** for tool consumption
3. **SmartOrchestrator not calling ArgResolver** with user context
4. **Tool parameter mapping incomplete** for profile data

## Success Criteria for Fix
After fixing tool personalization, we should see:

**Expected Brainstorm Results:**
```json
{
  "stories": [
    {
      "title": "Investment Portfolio Crisis During Market Crash",
      "description": "When the market dropped 20% in one week, Alex had to decide whether to panic-sell the investment club's portfolio or hold steady, teaching peers about long-term investing principles under pressure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tutoring Business Ethical Dilemma", 
      "description": "Alex discovered a paying client was pressuring students to cheat. Had to choose between profitable client and business integrity, ultimately developing new ethical guidelines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Model UN Crisis: Economic Policy Failure",
      "description": "Alex's economic proposal was completely rejected at a major conference, forcing a real-time strategy pivot and teaching humility in international negotiations."
    }
  ]
}
```

These stories would be **directly relevant** to Alex's actual experiences and could be developed into compelling essays about real challenges he might have faced.
