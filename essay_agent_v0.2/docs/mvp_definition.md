# üéØ Essay Agent v0.2: MVP Definition

## **What is the absolute minimum our system needs to do to provide real value?**

This document defines the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that would still meaningfully help students write better college essays while being achievable in a reasonable timeframe.

## üõ†Ô∏è **MVP Technical Architecture**

### **Simplified System Design:**

```
[Student] ‚Üí [Web App] ‚Üí [Single Agent] ‚Üí [GPT-4] ‚Üí [Simple Database]
```

### **Core Components (MVP):**

#### **1. Single Intelligent Agent**
- **Instead of**: 6 specialized agents
- **MVP**: One smart agent that can handle different tasks
- **Why**: Eliminates complex coordination, faster to build

#### **2. Simple Memory System**
- **Instead of**: Six-bank MIRIX system with Cognitive Weave
- **MVP**: Basic user profile + conversation history in PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: 
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "string",
    "name": "string", 
    "activities": ["strings"],
    "target_colleges": ["strings"],
    "writing_style_notes": "string",
    "conversation_history": [{"timestamp", "input", "output"}]
  }
  ```

#### **3. Core Tools (4 Only)**
- **smart_feedback**: Analyze essay and provide improvement suggestions
- **smart_improve**: Improve selected text while preserving voice  
- **smart_brainstorm**: Generate personalized story ideas
- **smart_chat**: Answer questions and provide guidance

#### **4. Simple Web Interface**
- **Instead of**: Complex cursor sidebar integration
- **MVP**: Clean web app with text areas and chat interface
- **Features**: Paste essay, select text, get feedback, chat with agent

#### **5. JSON-First (Simplified)**
- **Keep**: Pydantic validation for tool inputs/outputs
- **Simplify**: Basic structured prompts, not complex orchestration

### **Technology Stack (MVP):**
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Simple React app or even vanilla HTML/JS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL only (no vector DB, no Redis)
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Deployment**: Single Docker container

---

## ‚úÖ **MVP Success Criteria**

### **Technical Goals:**
- **0% tool parameter failures** (through Pydantic validation)
- **<5 second response times** (much simpler architecture)
- **99% uptime** (fewer moving parts)
- **Works for 50 concurrent users** (scale later)

### **User Experience Goals:**
- **Students can get useful essay feedback in 2 clicks**
- **Suggestions feel personalized to their background**
- **Voice preservation works 80% of the time**
- **Interface is intuitive without explanation**

### **Business Goals:**
- **Students find it more helpful than free alternatives**
- **Can demonstrate clear value before building complexity**
- **Provides foundation for future advanced features**

## ‚ùå **What's NOT in MVP**

### **Cut from Full Architecture:**
1. **Multi-agent coordination** ‚Üí Single smart agent
2. **Six-bank memory system** ‚Üí Simple profile + history
3. **Cognitive Weave** ‚Üí Basic personalization
4. **Hierarchical planning** ‚Üí Direct tool selection
5. **Cursor sidebar integration** ‚Üí Web app
6. **Advanced session management** ‚Üí Basic state
7. **Real-time synchronization** ‚Üí Standard request/response
8. **Complex goal completion detection** ‚Üí Simple task completion

### **Advanced Tools Cut:**
- Smart Draft (too complex for MVP)
- Smart Evaluate (feedback tool covers this)
- Smart Polish (improvement tool covers this)  
- Smart Classify Prompt (brainstorm tool covers this)

### **Advanced Features Cut:**
- Cross-session memory evolution
- Spatio-temporal resonance
- Multi-dimensional completion criteria
- Advanced error recovery
- Performance monitoring dashboards

## üöÄ **MVP Implementation Plan**

### **Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Set up FastAPI backend
- Create basic database schema
- Implement Pydantic models for 4 tools
- Basic OpenAI integration

### **Week 3-4: Core Tools**
- Implement 4 core tools with validation
- Basic agent that routes to tools
- Simple user profile management

### **Week 5-6: Interface & Polish**

## üéØ **MVP Validation Questions**

Before building the full architecture, the MVP should answer:

1. **Do students actually find AI essay feedback helpful?**
2. **Is basic personalization enough to feel valuable?**
3. **Can we achieve reliable tool execution?**
4. **Is the core value proposition compelling?**
5. **What features do users actually want next?**

---

## üîÑ **Path to Full System**

**If MVP succeeds:**
1. **Add memory sophistication** (episodic, semantic layers)
2. **Add more tools** (draft, evaluate, polish)
3. **Add sidebar integration** (cursor companion)
4. **Add multi-agent coordination** (if needed)
5. **Add advanced personalization** (Cognitive Weave)

**MVP Success = Green light for full architecture**  
**MVP Failure = Pivot or simplify further**
